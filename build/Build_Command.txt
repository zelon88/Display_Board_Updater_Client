Don't forget to update FileInfo.txt with the latest version information!

First, CD into the application source directory. Make sure there is a Build directory containing
  the Icon.ico and FileInfo.txt files. If there are any source files in the Build folder, they are 
  tweaked versions of the original files crafted for pyinstaller.

If you use absolute paths for the icon file, fileinfo file, or py source code file be sure
  to surround the paths with spaces (if they contain spaces).

pyinstaller --onefile --icon=Build\Icon.ico --version-file=Build\FileInfo.txt Build\Display_Board_Updater_Client.py
